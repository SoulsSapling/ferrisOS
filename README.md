For the less obvious terminal commands:


r.new opens a new terminal window


r.close closes the current terminal window


r.carapace opens a file explorer


r.sd shuts the machine down


r.wash clears the terminal

r.ide opens a text editor to write ferriscript, a small interpreted language built into the kernel


r.claw opens a text editor for simple text


r.ad is used to access a directory, example: r.ad carapace/1 (1 meaning folder 1)


r.ex is used to execute a file inside of a directory, example: r.ex script.ferris


r.sf shows the files of a directory


r.chest opens a music maker (note: the kernel will probably freeze if you try to access carapace after saving a .chest file)


and r.desk does.. nothing
