1. Install QEMU and add it to PATH

2. For some reason there is a folder I couldn't upload on github, so in the same directory as src and Cargo.toml, create a .cargo folder and inside of it create a config.toml file and add this content in it:

[unstable]
json-target-spec = true
build-std-features = ["compiler-builtins-mem"]
build-std = ["core", "compiler_builtins"]

[build]
target = "x86-64_ferris_os.json"



3. Build the kernel using this command: cargo bootimage


4. Use this command: qemu-system-x86_64 -drive format=raw,file=target/x86-64_ferris_os/debug/bootimage-ferrisOS.bin -audiodev dsound,id=snd0 -machine pcspk-audiodev=snd0
